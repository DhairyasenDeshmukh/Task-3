# Task-3
Analysis of Worldwide Air Pollution Data
This project analyzes a global air pollution dataset to assess air quality across different cities and countries. The dataset includes key pollution indicators such as AQI Value, PM2.5, NO2, CO, and Ozone levels. Our goal was to extract meaningful insights about pollution trends and optimize SQL queries for efficient data analysis.

# Key Insights Extracted:
-Most Polluted Cities – Identified the top 10 cities with the worst AQI levels.
-AQI Category Distribution – Counted how many cities fall into each air quality category.
-Average AQI per Country – Determined pollution levels across countries.
-Worst PM2.5 Levels – Found cities with the highest fine particulate matter pollution.
-NO2 Pollution Hotspots – Identified locations with excessive NO2 levels.
-AQI by Continent – Estimated pollution trends by grouping countries into continents.
-Highly Polluted Cities Subquery – Found cities exceeding the global AQI average.
-Country-Based Pollution Trends – Analyzed total PM2.5 levels per country.
-Joins with Population Data – Integrated external data (country population & GDP) for better insights.
-Database Optimization – Indexed critical columns for faster queries.
